By default, no information is shared on the class list other than the first name of your child. When you log in for the first time you will be presented with your privacy options, however these can be updated at any time by clicking on your &quot;Account&quot; icon and then on the &quot;Privacy&quot; tab. Then you will be presented with your privacy options - these options dictate what information you are happy to share with other parents within your child's class.<br><br>You will only see information about other children in your child's class if you have also chosen to share that particular information, for example, if you do not wish your email address to be shared, then you will also not be able to see the email address of parents who have opted to share their email. Parents can choose to share as much or as little information as they wish as per the options available. If a parent does not share any information, your child's first name will appear on the class list for other parents to see, but not any other information." %}
